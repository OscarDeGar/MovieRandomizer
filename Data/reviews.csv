2022-12-24,The Guilty,2021,https://boxd.it/3zzBlJ,3.5,,"Honestly one of Jake Gyllenhaal's better pieces I've seen. In between this, Nightcrawler, and other pieces, he is very emotional and captivating in his performance. I was shocked at how glued to the screen I was at at every new piece of information, and every new call. Keeps you clinged on waiting to see what's going to happen.",,2022-12-23
2023-08-28,We Have a Ghost,2023,https://boxd.it/4LnPun,1,,"Honestly the premise if you're looking for something on in the background or light-hearted sure not bad, but trying to watch this out of joy was difficult I stopped 3 times before I finished because oh how lost the movie felt in what it wanted to be, not scary enough to be horror, not that overly funny, and still tries to be a heartfelt family movie for a family you don't really connect with. Actors did awesome with what they were given, but the overall movie pretty meh🤷",,2023-03-24
2023-09-08,As the Gods Will,2014,https://boxd.it/4OHWwR,3,,What did I just watch😂😂😂,,2023-09-07
2024-03-01,Dune: Part Two,2024,https://boxd.it/5WFKcV,5,,If I could put 6 stars I would🙌🙌,,2024-02-29
2025-01-06,Nosferatu,2024,https://boxd.it/8lhWPX,4.5,,"Unnerving, terrifying, and the most anxious I've been in a movie. Eggers at his best, and overall a wonderful addition to the Dracula/Nosferatu Films",,2025-01-05
2025-05-19,Heretic,2024,https://boxd.it/9Jp6cz,3.5,,"Pretty good, interesting theological premise but screenplay can be a bit underwhelming at points/dialogue random at time, but still really enjoyable!

Also Sophie Thatcher and Chloe East giving me budget Thomasin Mackenzie and Anya Taylor-Joy vibes lol",,2025-05-18
2025-05-24,Novocaine,2025,https://boxd.it/9MB3hH,4,,"Funny, charming, gruesome in the most awesome absurd of ways for an action rom-com. Worth the watch👌👌",,2025-05-23
2025-05-31,Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning,2025,https://boxd.it/9R5jy1,4.5,,"A terrific close to such an influential series! The pacing can be a bit slow, and is mostly homages to older films in the series/goodbyes to characters, but regardless, still worth the watch👍",,2025-05-30
2025-05-31,Eraserhead,1977,https://boxd.it/9Rbt1X,5,,"Surreal, and brutally honest, truly brave. To call this a movie would be a disservice. This is a proper expression of someone's art. It's not going to make sense with everyone and not everyone will get it, I'm not even sure I fully got all the layers, but the expression of self and craft of David Lynch is something to sit with in this one and ponder.

Also, adorable baby",,2025-05-30
